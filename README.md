# Transaction Assignment

## How to run Code: 
This is a simple python project which requires no initial setup instructions. All you need to do is clone the repository and click run in your python ide!

## Suggestions for an official assignment
I think the overral structure of the assignment is pretty well explained and set up. One suggestion I have is to provide more test cases or a way to further test your functions with edge cases or a testing environment for your particular language. If this program were to be used in real life, it would be very important that all situations are covered so we are not getting transactional problems with users. One other thing is that the assignment could be made slightly more complicated, like make it a react project of some sort. You would ask the student to make a simple react app with the functionality, or given them started react code and tell them to implement the functionality. That way the project feels more like a full fledged app and not just some simple code. These are just some suggestions, and overrall I feel that the assignment is well laid out.
